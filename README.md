# GenAI_Mini_Project
In times of natural disasters (floods, earthquakes, wildfires, etc.), quick access to reliable information and guidance can save lives. This project uses Gemini API for real-time Q&amp;A and summarization, Vertex AI for custom intent classification, and Streamlit to provide an intuitive, interactive UI.
